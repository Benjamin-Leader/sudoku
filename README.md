sudoku
======

This sudoku project is built for HMC CS 121: software development. 
The game is for ipad, and contains all basic functionality of a 
traditional Sudoku game.


Functionality
======
The game requires a player to choose a number on the number-pad at
first and then fill that number to any mutable grid by tapping the
grid you would like to fill in. The game itself would only allow a
player to fill in the grid which satisfy a Sudoku game basic rule:
all row, column and 3*3 block constains number 1-9 without repeating.
The game would indicate if a player is win after he/she completed the
game.

Special ones:

1 The game allows a player to undo what he/she has done in order:
the player could undo any number of steps before he/she move on.
However, the player could not undo any steps after filling in new 
grids with any number.

2 There is a tag, which acts as a bulletin that would tell the total
steps and steps left.

3 The player could begin a new game or restart the game at any time.

4 The player could turn on the easy mode, by which, the number selected
on the number-pad would be highlighted on the grid, so the player would
now where he/she could not fill that number on the grid.
